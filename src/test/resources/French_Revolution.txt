The French Revolution, which began in 1789 and lasted until 1799, was one of the most significant events in modern history. It marked the end of absolute monarchy in France, challenged centuries-old social hierarchies, and laid the foundation for modern democratic ideals. Sparked by deep economic troubles, rising inequality, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas, the revolution dramatically reshaped France and left a lasting legacy across the world.

Prior to the revolution, France was governed by an absolute monarchy under King Louis XVI. Society was divided into three rigid classes, known as the Estates. The First Estate consisted of the clergy, the Second Estate was the nobility, and the Third Estate included the vast majority of the population—peasants, urban workers, and the emerging middle class (bourgeoisie). The Third Estate bore the heaviest tax burden but had the least power and representation. Economic problems, such as rising food prices, debt from wars including the American Revolution, and poor harvests, intensified public unrest.

Enlightenment philosophers like Voltaire, Rousseau, and Montesquieu challenged traditional authority and promoted ideas such as liberty, equality, and popular sovereignty. These ideas inspired people to question the legitimacy of the monarchy and demand change. When King Louis XVI convened the Estates-General in 1789 to address the financial crisis, tensions quickly rose. The Third Estate, feeling marginalized, broke away and formed the National Assembly, vowing to draft a new constitution.

This move marked the beginning of the revolution. One of the most iconic moments was the storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789. The Bastille, a royal prison, symbolized tyranny and the oppression of the monarchy. Its fall became a powerful symbol of the people's revolt. Soon after, the National Assembly abolished feudal privileges and adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, which emphasized individual rights and equality before the law.

However, the revolution took a more radical turn in the following years. The monarchy was abolished in 1792, and King Louis XVI was executed in January 1793. This period, known as the Reign of Terror, was led by the radical Jacobins under Maximilien Robespierre. Thousands were executed by guillotine, including Queen Marie Antoinette, as revolutionary leaders sought to purge enemies of the revolution. Fear, political instability, and violence gripped the country.

By 1794, the Reign of Terror ended with the fall of Robespierre. France struggled with internal divisions and foreign wars, leading to the rise of a new leader—Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1799, he seized power through a coup d’état and eventually declared himself Emperor. While Napoleon ended the revolution in a political sense, many revolutionary principles endured in French law and society.

The French Revolution had a profound impact on the world. It challenged monarchies, inspired democratic movements, and redefined ideas about citizenship and human rights. Though it was marked by turmoil and bloodshed, the revolution remains a powerful symbol of the people's fight for freedom and justice.
