The French Revolution, which began in 1789 and lasted until 1799, was one of the most significant events in modern history. It marked the end of absolute monarchy in France, challenged centuries-old social hierarchies, and laid the foundation for modern democratic ideals. Sparked by deep economic troubles, rising inequality, and the influence of Enlightenment ideas, the revolution dramatically reshaped France and left a lasting legacy across the world.
